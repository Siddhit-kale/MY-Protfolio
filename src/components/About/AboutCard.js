          Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Kale Siddhit</span> from <span className="purple">Vadodara, Gujarat, India.</span> 
          I am a student at Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT), currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science. 
          I have a strong passion for technology and programming, which drives me to continuously learn and improve my skills. My experience includes web development & APP development, where Iâ€™ve worked with various technologies such as React, Node.js, and Flutter.  
          In addition to my technical skills, I believe in the importance of teamwork and effective communication.

            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
